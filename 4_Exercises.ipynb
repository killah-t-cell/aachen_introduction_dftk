    "## Exercise 1: Why do we need pseudopotentials? (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "It was discussed in the lecture that plane-wave DFT codes usually employ so-called pseudopotentials (PSP) to model the interaction of electrons and nuclei. Replacing the true Coulombic interaction by a PSP is an approximation. Multiple types of PSPs exist and from a mathematical perspective little is understood about the errors introduced by PSPs. However, from a physical point of view using PSPs is reasonable as it only effects the electron density close to the nuclei, which for most phaenomena only plays a minor role. On the upside PSPs turn out to make plane-wave calculations much more feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aspect we will investigate numerically in this exercise. Our goal will be to determine the energy of a single neon atom using the so-called LDA approximation up to an absolute error of `0.1`. We will do this by an explicit convergence study, i.e. by increasing the basis size and improving the numerics until we are sure we have found the energy to this tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our computational setup is simple: We will put a single neon atom into a cubic box of length $a$. As DFTK uses periodic boundary conditions, this atom interacts spuriously with the neighbouring cells, introducing an error to our calculation. As $a \\to \\infty$ this error disappears, which is one of the convergence parameters we will study. The other is the $E_\\text{cut}$ parameter discussed in the lecture, which determines the basis set size. Again calculations get better for $E_\\text{cut} \\to \\infty$. In the language of DFTK the calculation we want to perform is:"

    "(ii) As it turns out too small basis sets and Brilouin-zone sampling (too small `kgrid`s) are not able to support magnetic ground states. Repeat both the silicon as well as the iron calculations for different values of `Ecut` and `kgrid` (i.e. `[1,1,1]`,`[3,3,3]`, `[4,4,4]` etc.), where in both cases larger means better. Play with these parameters to determine the first two digits of the ground state energy of silicon and iron. Based on these numerical parameters what do you conclude now?"

    "(iii) To show that a non-magnetic iron structure is actually higher in energy re-run the iron calculation with the `Ecut` and `kgrid` parameters determined in (ii), but this time set `magnetic_moments = [Fe ==> [0]]`. This enforces the SCF to converge to a non-magnetic ground state. This is why the magnetisation `Magnet` is no longer printed ... it is `0` by assumption. What is the energy difference between this non-magnetic iron ground state and the ground state you determined in (ii)?"
